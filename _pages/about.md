<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a master‚Äôs student (Class of 2024) at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Beihang University. I will begin my Ph.D. studies in Artificial Intelligence in September 2025 under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenjun-Wu-15">Wenjun Wu</a>.

My research focuses on controlling multi-robot systems via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). To address the challenges of reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world training, I combine domain expertise with RL to improve sample efficiency and convergence. This strategy not only alleviates the limitations of RL in real-world training, but also extends the applicability of MARL in multi-robot manipulation. In addition, I am also interested in embodied artificial intelligence based on large language models (LLMs) and multi-robot task planning.
